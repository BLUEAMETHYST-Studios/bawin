# Contribution

## Malicious Code

Contributing ANY code, that is malicious will get rejected and you won't be able to contribute. \
Malicious code can be, but is not limited to:

- Trojans
- Ransomware
- Spyware
- Adware
- Keyloggers

## How the code was made

Even though we can't know, that a large chunk or every line of your code was generated by an AI model, such as ChatGPT, we don't allow contributions, in which a huge bit or everything was generated by an AI model. \
Such models can be, but aren't limited to:

- Github Copilot
- GPT
- Google Bard
- Bing AI

If some parts of your code were made by those models, then it isn't a problem, BUT NOT a huge part of it.

Consequences are different from case to case.

## "Useless" contributions

Contributions, which wouldn't have added anything meaningful or even bad code will be rejected. \
No further consequences, EXCEPT those contributions are trolls.
